# Machine-Learning
The repository enclosed different machine learning models I have constructed throughout my study in Decision Analytics. The models are divided into two categories: 

- models using scikit-learn; and 
- models built from scratch

Not only I learned how to apply these models, I have also gained a deep understanding of objective function, optimisation algorithm, regularisation and feature engineering techniques. I am able to analyse the pros and cons of different machine learning algorithms and select appropriate methods based on the nature of datasets.
